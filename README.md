Ayra operates on a [public-by-default basis](https://governance.ayra.forum/governance-artifacts/transparency). Our governance documents, working group materials, meeting notes, and decisions are publicly accessible. Editing rights are limited to members, and all changes are traceable. This approach ensures openness, accountability, and long-term trust.
